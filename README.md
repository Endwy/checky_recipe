# shoky recipe database
hello welcome to this database thingy

as you can see there are 4 files here

- [ ] changelist.json
- [ ] change2.json
- [ ] ebookchange.json
- [ ] recipe2.json

Don't question me about the weird names. Allow me to explain what these files do:

## Uses for files

- changelist.json: checks if a certain word inputted is a thing, and then changes the word (key) into the value
- change2.json: checks if the entire input is equal to a key. If so, replace entire thing with the value.
- ebookchange.json: a shortcut for enchanted books.
- recipe2.json: a recipe database lol

## additional notes

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE SYNTAXES IN ALL THE FILES!!!

For example, in recipe2.json you must capitalize the item names.
